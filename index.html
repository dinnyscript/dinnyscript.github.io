                        Hi! I'm Edward Mei, a software developer who goes by the pseudonym Dinnyscript. 
                        Many of my past projects are HTML games with a focus on minimalistic graphics and polished game mechanics - 
                        some of them are made with game engines, but the majority are made using vanilla JS with 
                        soundtracks composed by me or my friends.
                        I'm also an avid competitive programmer, although you probably won't see much of that here.

                                A bullet hell game where the faces of a die manipulate the state of your shield. Made for the GMTK Game Jam 2022. 
                                Note: the game isn't the most playable in terms of difficulty and learning curve; 
                                it's more of a technical trophy as one of the first complete projects I made with WebGL.
